# About Me

Hi, I'm Lanna, an MSc Information Systems student specializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). My work focuses on understanding how people interact with technology, particularly in the context of human–AI interaction, ethical design, and data-driven decision-making.

This repository serves as a collection of my academic and personal projects, showcasing research work, data analysis projects, and experiments developed throughout my studies and professional experience. The goal of this space is to document my learning process, research interests, and practical applications of HCI and data analysis methods.

## Data Visualization Project
In this data visualization project, we explored disparities in education among the different demographics in Israel in 2021. We looked at data from high school-level and university-level education, then compared them side by side.
You can explore them in this order:
- High school-level education analysis: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lanna.labai/viz/Project_16907479067860/HighSchoolStory?publish=yes
- University-level education analysis: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lanna.labai/viz/Project_16907479067860/UniversityStory?publish=yes
- Comparison of high-school-level and university-level education: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lanna.labai/viz/Project_16907479067860/RelationshipbetweenUniversityStudentsIsraeli-DegreeHoldersandHighSchoolStudentsinIsrael?publish=yes

## Sociotechnical Solution for Teachers Project
In this project, we designed a technological solution aimed to a certain problem within a sociotechnical system. We chose to focus on special education teachers and their pain points while using traditional learning management systems in their jobs.

## XAI Perceptions in EMS Project
This project was an survey-based experiment that I designed for my research methods class as an extension of my thesis which explores AI integration in emergency medical services (EMS) to support decision-making. In this project, I investigated how providing explanations for AI-generated treatment suggestions influences EMS personnel’s perceptions of accuracy, comprehensibility, thoroughness, usefulness, and cognitive effort. I did this by creating 2 condition groups of EMS personnel ("AI recommendation" and "AI recommendation and Explanation") and a control group that provided the actual treatments to compare with the AI-generated ones.

## UX Final Product Document
This was a UX project in which I described the product plan for a community app designed for smaller communities and villages that I came up with. The app will act as a hub and archive for all information relevant to each village, including information about social events or businesses in the village and promotional or general messages from the local council or community center. The purpose was to encourage the residents’ further involvement in the community and making information accessible to everyone. You can view the low-fidelity prototype here: https://www.figma.com/proto/lXPv1figJ2cUw03X3yBFmv/Village-App?node-id=3-2&t=JvLCQO7lJgcgzI8z-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A2

## Privacy Dark Patterns Literature Review
This was a literature review that I conducted where I asked: How do Dark UX Patterns affect end users’ online privacy perceptions? I employed thematic analysis to analyze the papers, and found that while there are  overlaps between effects of dark patterns on end user perceptions of the websites they use and end user privacy perceptions, I also found that there is a gap in the literature that does not specifically explore how dark patterns directly affect privacy perceptions.

## UI Projects (Not uploaded)
In my UI design class, I had the opportunity to experiment with figma and (shallow) interface design.

## Hotel Guest Management App (Not uploaded)
This is a low-fidelity prototype of a customer management app that allows the hotel to manage customer requests and services in one app: https://www.figma.com/proto/otkzIoIsgGTaxXCKtak1w9/Untitled?node-id=3-87&p=f&t=tmCOxFzAYbxprFgZ-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A87&show-proto-sidebar=1
