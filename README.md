# About Me

Hi, I'm Lanna, an MSc Information Systems student specializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). My work focuses on understanding how people interact with technology, particularly in the context of human–AI interaction, ethical design, and data-driven decision-making.

This repository serves as a collection of my academic and personal projects, showcasing research work, data analysis projects, and experiments developed throughout my studies and professional experience. The goal of this space is to document my learning process, research interests, and practical applications of HCI and data analysis methods.
